## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a senior undergraduate studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. I will be pursuing a Masters in Engineering with a Design concentration starting Spring 2026 semester. At Cornell University I am a part of various clubs such as Cornell Design Build Fly, the Beta Chi Chapter of Alpha Omega Epsilon, and Cornell Club Tennis. I am interested in the aerospace, renewable energy, and manufacturing industries and particularly enjoy working with carbon fiber layups and CAD softwares. Outside of academics I am an avid puzzler and enjoy various art medias from calligraphy to painting.
