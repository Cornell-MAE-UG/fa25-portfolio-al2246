## Introduction
In 2018 and 2019, two tragic accidents occurred when inaccurate measurements from a faulty sensor caused a new software system to pitch the plane nose downwards multiple times, eventually causing the planes to crash. The Boeing 737 MAX incidents were a direct failure due to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) designed by Boeing engineers, however, there are many other factors and stakeholders that led up to this. 

Not only were the Boeing engineers at fault for these crashes, but also Boeing upper management, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulators, pilots, and airlines had influence in the decisions leading up to the accidents. There were lots of groups involed and lots of reasons for why the failures occured. I analyzed facts, ASME canons, and ethical conflicts to identify root issues a potential solutions to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. 

## Ethical Issues
The major ethical issues I chose to focus on are listed below:
1. Should design concerns be voiced to upper management?
2. Do you possess the necessary technical skills to contribute?
3. Should there be required trainings for new technologies?
4. What should be prioritized when designing and by what standards?
5. Should the public be informed about new plane technologies?

I chose these 5 main ethical issues because it encompases various different aspects of the issue from technical  to marketing and administrative. All together these issues address the failure of the MCAS, the pilots insufficient knowledge of the plane, the poor regulation standards, and the underlying pressures faced by Boeing. 

## Facts
From the various class activities we did in MAE 4300, I identified individual, material, and oganizational facts that contribute to the analysis of the 5 ethical concerns I focused on. 

**Individual Facts**
- A Boeing engineer sent an email voicing a concern about the MCAS relying on the measurement of one angle of attack (AOA) sensor which are known to be faulty
- A Boeing spokeperson said that MCAS is certified with FAA requirements
- A pilot who tested the 737 MAX plane stated that the ramifications of an AOA failure were not taken as seriously as it should have been
- Pilots did not think data from one AOA sensor was a suitable solution
- Whistleblowers reported a fear of retaliation if they spoke up about their concerns

**Material Facts**
- The MCAS was used to compensate for inadequacies in hardware design such as heavier engines moving the center of gravity (COG) 
- In 2018, Boeing was certifying 96% of its own work with permission of the FAA
- The nose of the 737 MAX tended to pitch upwards
- The MCAS moves the horizontal stabilizer to push the nose of the plane downwards
- The FAA has received reports of AOA sensors failing or needing reparis

**Organizational Facts**
- After the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashes, the FAA grounded the Boeing 737 MAX
- To stay competitive with Airbus, Boeing decided to modify the 737 NG plane instead of a compelte redesign
- Boeing blamed pilots for the crashes and defended the MCAS
- In 1997, Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas
- The FAA did not require pilots to receive training for the 737 MAX plane and the new MCAS technology

Reasonable assumptions can be made from these facts to paint a more holistic painting of how the Boeing 737 MAX incident happened. It starts with Airbus releasing a new plane model that is more fuel efficient which creates pressure on Boeing to come up with a competing design in a short timeline to saty competitive. To remain competitive with Airbus and deliver an alternative on a tight deadline, Boeing chose to modify their 737 NG instead of doing a complete redesign. Boeing engineers chose to instal larger, heavier engines on the 737NG fuselage which altered the aircraft’s COG, causing the nose to pitch upwards. Boeing implemented the MCAS which automatically moves the horizontal stabilizer to pitch the nose back down. The MCAS depends on data from 1 of the 2 AOA sensors on the plane. There were known issues with the reliability of these sensors, a concern which was raised by both pilots and engineers. Despite the concerns, Boeing went ahead with the system which could have resulted from upper management wanting to prioritize meeting deadlines to be able to produce a direct competitor to Airbus's new A320. Since Boeing was allowed to self regulate by the FAA, a standard ensuring public safety was compromised as this introduces a level of bias that may occur; Boeing might approve of technologies that don't necessarily meet the requirements to align with the companies values which had shifted after the merger with Mcdonnell Douglas. Airlines and the FAA also did not provide training for the pilots because in addition to the marketing standpoint that Boeing had advertised the 737 MAX to be very similar to their old 737, it would also save money. As a result, the pilots who would be flying these new 737 MAX planes did not know about MCAS and might have trouble identifying the issue when an AOA sensor malfunctions and the plane starts pitching the nose down despite flying at a functional angle of attack. Boeing initially defended MCAS and attributed the crashes to pilot error saying that they should have been skilled enough to handle the situation. Following the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, the FAA grounded the 737 MAX, marking a significant failure in both engineering judgment and safety oversight. Judgements that were not made by any one stakeholder group, but again an accumulation of many bad decisions from many different organizations and individuals.

## ASME Canons
The following ASME Canons were identified in relation to the ethical issues being addressed:

Canon 1: Engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public in the performance of their professional duties

Canon 2: Engineers shall perform services only in areas of their competence; they shall build their professional reputation on the merit of their services and shall not compete unfairly with others

Canon 3: Engineers shall continue their professional development throughout their careers and shall provide opportunities for the professional and ethical development of those engineers under their supervision

Canon 4: Engineers shall act in professional matters for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees and shall avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest

Canon 7: Engineers shall issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner and shall avoid any conduct which brings discredit upon the profession

Canon 9: Engineers shall not seek ethical sanction against another engineer unless there is good reason to do so under the relevant codes, policies and procedures governing that engineer's ethical conduct

There are many canons that are addressed in the Boeing 737 MAX incident and it can be difficult to navigate these especially because some canons seems to conflict with one another. For example, canons 1 and 4 conflict because although public safety should be held paramount, it is also important to be faithful to the company. This could raise an ethical dilema whether or not engineers should speak up with issues that may not align with the company's culture, but may be beneficial for the well being of the public. These contradicting statements shows the added complexity of the incident and highlights the ethical dilemas that the stakeholders are facing.

## Addressing Ethical Issues
Circling back to the ethical issues with the facts and canons above, I suggested the following hierarchy decisions to be made along with potential solutions to avoid these ethical problems on an individual, organizational, and systemic level. 

1: Should design concerns be voiced to upper management?
ASME canon 1 takes precedence and so design concerns over things that could protect the public should be prioritized over employer loyalty and the managers should address these concerns seriously.

On an individual level, ethical training can be used to support ethical decision-making under pressure. On an organizational level, whistleblower protections can be put in place to protect the jobs of those who are courageous enough to bring up safety concerns when there is an uneven power dynamic. On a systemic level, stronger professional standards can be enforced. 

2: Do you possess the necessary technical skills to contribute?
ASME canon 2 says that engineers should only contribute in areas they are qualified for and per canon 3, engineers should continue to develop their professional and ethical skills to be able to stay competant. 

On an individual level, trainings and workshops for technical and professional skills can be provided for all employees. On an organizational level, informational transparency across engineering teams should be enacted. On a systemic level, there could be an industry wide assessment to ensure the tehcnical knowledge continues to be strong.

3: Should there be required trainings for new technologies?
Canon 1 would conclude that trainings should be required for new technologies to make sure those operating the aircraft are informed and can perform their duties in a manner that will prioritize the passengers safety.

On an individual level, yearly pilot training should be required to review and learn information. On an organizational level, FAA, Boeing, and airlines could review the certification and needs for training. Additionally, very limited self regulation should be allowed to prevent biases from degrading certification standards. On a systemic level, indsutry wide agreements should be reached to prevent important training from being neglected due to costs.

4: What should be prioritized when designing and by what standards?
When desgining, canon 1 will be "hold paramount" public welfare. This means that public welfare should be prioritized over deadlines, profit, and everything else. 

On an individual level, ethical trainings can address employer loyalty and public safety conflicts. On an organizational level, the company can transform the workplace culture to prioritize safety over profit. And finally, on a systemic level, companies could come together to reach an agreement that would prevent safety from becoming a competitive disadvantage. 

5: Should the public be informed about new plane technologies?
ASME canon 7 supports the argument that the public should be informed of new technologies by the company in an honest and accoutnable manner because it impacts their well being. 

On an individual level, media and ethical training should be provided for employees especially those with direct contact with the media and general public. On an organizational level, again a shift in the company culture could be used to prioritize public safety as well as transparency and accountability over fear of tarnishing the company image. Systemically, there could be international coordination to require certain information from all companies to be shared with the public. 

## Conclusion
The Boeing 737 MAX incidents should serve as a reminder that as engineers we hold an ethical responsibility to the public to ensure their safety and earn their trust. Catastrophic failures can arise when technical shortcomings, organizational pressures, and ethical conflicts intersect. These accidents highlighted deeper systemic issues such as management priorities, regulatory oversight, and insufficient training. The analysis of material facts alongside the ASME canons shows that public safety was repeatedly compromised in favor of cost, schedule, and competitiveness. The responsibility does not rest with a single individual or organization, but with a network of stakeholders whose collective decisions enabled the failure. The lessons leaened from this tragedy should inspire engineers to do better by reinforcing ethical training, strengthening regulatory independence, encouraging transparency, and prioritizing safety above all else.
